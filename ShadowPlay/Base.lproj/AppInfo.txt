ShadowPlay is an exploration of the architecture and light in outdoor spaces through sound. Using a bicycle-mounted sensor and a smartphone aimed skywards, the mottled patterns of light and shadow become the musical score and one rides along their city streets. Much like a simple music box plucked by patterns of pins on a rotating wheel, the transitions between light and dark as you ride control playback of prepared sequences, generated patterns, or prepared audio playback speed.
