	"description" : "Based on Enrique Erneâ€™s piece which is based on a piece by Steve Reich, Twelve Tone Aphasia uses the incoming light to control the phases of two piano sequences. The piano sequences come from the first light the app sees put into the 12 tone magic square based on the 12 tone Matrix by Aqueronte.8352. This first impression is then forever re-mixed and replayed until the app is re-started with a new one.",
